# Azure ATP for US Government GCC High

The Azure ATP GCC High offering utilizes the same underlying technologies and capabilities as the commercial instance of Azure ATP. A list of feature variances can be found in the [Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-azure-atp-govt-service-description).

## Get started with US Government GCC High

The Azure ATP GCC High offering is built on the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud and is designed to inter-operate with Microsoft 365 GCC High. Use Azure ATP public documentation as a [starting point](install-atp-step1.md) for deploying and operating the service and refer to the [Service Description](/enterprise-mobility-security/solutions/ems-azure-atp-govt-service-description) which details all changes from functionality or features specific to the GCC High environment.
